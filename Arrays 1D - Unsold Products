In a coding project you are developing a feature for a data visualization tool that process large datasets of products stored in array A. One dataset contains sales figures for various products where a sale value of 0 indicates that the product was not sold during a specific period. Your task is to find and return an integer array representing the dataset representing all the unsold products at the end.

Input Format

An integer N containing the array size
An integer array A containing sales number of a particular product.
List Item
Constraints

NA

Output Format

Return an integer array representing the dataset representing all the unsold products at the end.

Sample Input 0

7
5 2 0 8 0 2 1
Sample Output 0

5 2 8 2 1 0 0
Explanation 0

Here, A = {5, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 1}. The dataset contains zeros at position 2 and 4. After shifting all zeros to the end, the non-zero elements {5, 2, 8, 2, 1} retain the original order. And the last two positions will be occupied with zeros.

Sample Input 1
