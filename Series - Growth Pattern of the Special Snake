A special snake grows rapidly, and its length squares every 30 seconds. The forestry team generated a series based on this growth pattern. Your task is to print the first 'n' terms of the following series:

1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...

Each term is the square of its position in the series.

Input Format

An integer 'n' which denotes the number of terms to be printed in the series.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

Print the series, where each term is separated by a space.

Sample Input 0

7
Sample Output 0

1 4 9 16 25 36 49
Explanation 0

The first 7 terms of the series are the squares of integers from 1 to 7, so the output is 1,4,9,16,25,36,49.

Sample Input 1

2
Sample Output 1

1 4
Explanation 1

For Input 2 (n=2), the first 2 terms are the squares of 1 and 2, resulting in 1,4.
