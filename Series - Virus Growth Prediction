In a country, a new virus has been discovered, and its growth pattern is of utmost importance to health experts and government agencies. The virus initially starts with a value of 0.5, and each day, it multiplies by 3. Researchers have been tasked with predicting the virus's growth over a certain number of days to understand its spread and take necessary preventive measures. The growth follows a predictable mathematical series where the virus’s value triples each day.

Your task is to help health professionals generate the virus growth prediction for a given number of days.

Given an integer n, your task is to generate the first n terms of the series that describes the virus's growth. The first term starts at 0.5, and each subsequent term is three times the previous term.

Write a program that will take n as input and print the first n terms of the series in the format specified below.

Input Format

The input consists of a single integer n which denotes the number of terms to be printed in the series.

Constraints

n will be a positive integer.

Output Format

The output should be the series of the first n terms, printed as space-separated floating-point numbers, formatted to one decimal place.

Sample Input 0

5
Sample Output 0

0.5 1.5 4.5 13.5 40.5
Explanation 0

For the first sample input n = 5, the series is generated by multiplying each term by 3 starting from 0.5.

0.5 × 3 = 1.5
1.5 × 3 = 4.5
4.5 × 3 = 13.5
13.5 × 3 = 40.5
Therefore, the output is 0.5 1.5 4.5 13.5 40.5.

Sample Input 1

1
Sample Output 1

0.5
Explanation 1

For the second sample input n = 1, the series only contains the first term, which is 0.5.
