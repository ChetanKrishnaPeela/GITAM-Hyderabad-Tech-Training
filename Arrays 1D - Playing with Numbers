Ryan is given an array of random integers of size n, a number d is provided to him along with this array. He needs to develop a logic such that it shifts the given array elements by d positions towards the left. Write a function for him and return the updated array.

Input Format

An integer n i.e., size of the array
Integer array which are elements of the array.
Integer d
Constraints

NA

Output Format

Return the updated array after the shift.

Sample Input 0

7  
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
2  
Sample Output 0

3 4 5 6 7 1 2 
Explanation 0

For the given d, i.e., 2 for above case such element is shifted by 2 places to left, and the initial 2 elements are required to be shifted from behind, hence array is being rotated

Sample Input 1

9  
1 7 8 5 4 6 0 2 3  
3
Sample Output 1

5 4 6 0 2 3 1 7 8
Explanation 1

As the elements are shifted 3 positions to the left, therefore initial 3 elements after being shifted appear at the tail of the array and accordingly other elements are shifted 3 positions towards left.

        int arr[] = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        
        int ans[] = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            ans[i] = arr[(i+m)%(n)];
        }
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            System.out.print(ans[i]+" ");
        }
    }
}
