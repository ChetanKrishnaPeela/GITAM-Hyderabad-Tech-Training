Imagine a company implementing a system to organize files in a unique manner. Files are numbered sequentially, but they must be arranged such that all even-numbered files are placed first, followed by all odd-numbered files. The sequence starts from 1, and you are required to generate a series of numbers in this specific order: even numbers followed by odd numbers, up to N terms.

Your task is to write a program to generate the series: 2,1,4,3,6,5,â€¦ up to Nterms.

Input Format

A single integer N, representing the number of terms to generate in the series.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

A single line containing N terms of the series, separated by spaces.

Sample Input 0

6
Sample Output 0

2 1 4 3 6 5
Explanation 0

The first three even numbers are: 2, 4, 6.
The first three odd numbers are: 1, 3, 5.
Arranging them alternately gives: 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5.
Sample Input 1

4
Sample Output 1

2 1 4 3
Explanation 1

The first two even numbers are: 2, 4.
The first two odd numbers are: 1, 3.
Arranging them alternately gives: 2, 1, 4, 3.
