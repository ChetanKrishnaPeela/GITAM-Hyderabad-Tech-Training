In a city, urban planners are modeling population growth using a predictive series to estimate how the population will expand over the years. The goal is to write a program that generates and prints the first N terms of this series, which is derived from observed data patterns. The series follows the pattern: 1,3,4,8,15,27,50,â€¦

Input Format

A single integer N, representing the number of terms to generate in the series.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

A single line containing N terms from the series, separated by spaces.

Sample Input 0

6
Sample Output 0

1 3 4 8 15 27
Explanation 0

Start with 1 and 3.
The third term is 4.
The fourth term is 4+4=8.
The fifth term is 8+7=15.
The sixth term is 15+12=27.
